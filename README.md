# AlternativeLayouts
A simple iOS project to demo alternative iOS layouts using UITabBarController
It has 2 tabs:

- Tab index 0 is used in Portrait mode.
- Tab index 1 is used in Landscape mode.

When device is rotated, the corresponding view will be shown. It was used when you want to show different views in different orientation.
